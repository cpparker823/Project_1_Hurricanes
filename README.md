# Project_1_Hurricanes
Our project was to identify long-term trends and patterns in hurricane severity. By examining data, we can determine if there are any significant changes in storm intensity over the years.
We asked:
1)   What is the overall trend in the number of hurricanes over time?
2)   Is there a correlation between the number of hurricanes vs high desert temperatures combined with lower ocean temperatures?
3)   Do higher desert temperatures produce more named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes?
4) How does wind and evapotranspiration contribute to storm creation and what correlations will we see?   
Our hypothesis is that we would see strong correlations between temperature and number of storms as well as wind and number of storms. We also thought some of the storms may be in cycles due to what is publicized about climate change. 
Analysis and Conclusion
The number of storms and hurricanes have shown an increasing trend over the last 72 years. 
Higher desert temperatures in September increase the likelihood of observed storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes for that year. The data showed a positive correlation of 0.31 for desert temperatures and negative correlation of -0.10 ocean temperatures. 
The ocean evapotranspiration rate for each September had little correlation with an r-value of 0.27 for the observed storms.
